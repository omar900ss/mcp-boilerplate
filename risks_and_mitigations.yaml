    title: "Technical Risks"
    items:
      - risk: "Complexity of Integrating Two New Systems (Paddle & Lago)"
        description: >
          Simultaneously integrating two distinct platforms (Paddle for payments/MoR, Lago for billing/subscriptions)
          increases architectural complexity compared to a single solution like Stripe. Managing interactions,
          data synchronization, and potential conflicts between them can be challenging.
        mitigations:
          - "Phased Integration: If feasible, integrate one system at a time, or start with a core set of features."
          - "Clear API Contracts: Define clear responsibilities and API interaction contracts between MCP, Paddle, and Lago (as outlined in `architecture_changes.yaml`)."
          - "Robust Orchestration Layer: Develop a strong orchestration layer within the MCP application to manage workflows and data consistency between Paddle and Lago."
          - "Thorough End-to-End Testing: Implement comprehensive testing covering various scenarios, including payment processing, subscription lifecycle management, usage reporting, and webhook handling."
          - "Dedicated Client Services: Utilize `lagoClient.ts` and `paddleClient.ts` to encapsulate and manage interactions, simplifying the core application logic."

      - risk: "Webhook Reliability and Management"
        description: >
          The system will heavily rely on webhooks from both Paddle and Lago for real-time updates
          (payment success, subscription changes, invoice generation). Missed or delayed webhooks, or
          errors in webhook processing, can lead to data inconsistencies and poor user experience.
          (See `architecture_changes.yaml` - Webhook Processing Strategy)
        mitigations:
          - "Idempotent Handlers: Design webhook handlers in `src/webhooks/paddle.ts` and `src/webhooks/lago.ts` to be idempotent to prevent duplicate processing."
          - "Asynchronous Processing: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Streams) to decouple webhook ingestion from processing, improving resilience and scalability."
          - "Robust Error Handling & Retries: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed webhook processing and dead-letter queues for persistent failures."
          - "Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring: Set up detailed logging and real-time monitoring for webhook flows to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues."
          - "Signature Verification: Strictly verify all incoming webhook signatures to ensure authenticity."

      - risk: "Performance Issues with High Volume Usage/Billing"
        description: >
          Self-hosted Lago instance or external API calls to Paddle might face performance bottlenecks
          under high load (e.g., end-of-month billing runs for many customers, high volume of usage events).
        mitigations:
          - "Scalable Lago Deployment: Ensure the self-hosted Lago instance is deployed on appropriately scaled infrastructure with capabilities for vertical and horizontal scaling."
          - "Efficient Usage Reporting: Optimize the submission of usage data to Lago (e.g., batching events where appropriate, efficient data structures)."
          - "Performance Testing: Conduct rigorous performance and load testing on critical paths, especially billing cycle processing and usage aggregation in Lago."
          - "API Rate Limit Awareness: Be mindful of Paddle's API rate limits and implement client-side throttling or queuing if necessary."
          - "Database Optimization: Ensure MCP's own database, which links various IDs and states, is optimized for query performance."

      - risk: "Steep Learning Curve for Development Team"
        description: >
          Developers need to learn two new platforms (Paddle and Lago), their APIs, data models, and best practices,
          which can slow down initial development and increase the risk of implementation errors.
        mitigations:
          - "Dedicated Training: Allocate time for developers to go through Paddle and Lago documentation and training materials."
          - "Proof of Concepts: Develop small proofs-of-concept for key integrations before full-scale implementation."
          - "Expert Consultation: Consider engaging with Paddle or Lago support/professional services for initial guidance if available."
          - "Incremental Rollout: Start with a subset of features or a pilot group of users to gain experience."

  business_risks:
    title: "Business Risks (including Compliance)"
    items:
      - risk: "Paddle MoR Limitations or Gaps for Specific Business Needs"
        description: >
          While Paddle acts as a Merchant of Record, its standard offerings might have limitations
          or gaps in handling specific or complex business requirements that were previously
          custom-managed with Stripe (e.g., highly customized invoicing, specific tax exemptions not covered by default).
        mitigations:
          - "Thorough Due Diligence: Extensive upfront research on Paddle's capabilities and limitations regarding the company's specific business model and edge cases."
          - "Clarification with Paddle Sales/Support: Directly address specific needs with Paddle to understand their support or workaround options."
          - "Customization in MCP/Lago: Be prepared to build some custom logic within MCP or leverage Lago's flexibility to handle requirements that fall outside Paddle's standard MoR services, ensuring this doesn't conflict with Paddle's MoR role (especially around tax)."

      - risk: "KSA Compliance Challenges (Fatoorah, Local Payment Methods)"
        description: >
          Ensuring full compliance with Saudi Arabian regulations (e.g., Fatoorah e-invoicing phases,
          full support for Mada/SADAD) might be dependent on Paddle's evolving capabilities or require
          complex workarounds if Paddle's native support is insufficient.
          (Reference: `saudi_compliance_considerations.yaml`)
        mitigations:
          - "Continuous Monitoring of Paddle KSA Capabilities: Stay updated on Paddle’s support for KSA-specific payment methods and Fatoorah compliance phases."
          - "Local Expertise: Consult with local legal and financial experts in KSA to ensure all compliance aspects are met."
          - "Flexible MCP/Lago Configuration: Design MCP and Lago configurations to be adaptable. For Fatoorah, this might mean being ready to integrate a third-party e-invoicing solution if Paddle’s offering is not fully compliant with ZATCA's requirements, using data from Lago and Paddle."
          - "Prioritize SAR and VAT: Ensure Paddle can handle SAR transactions and KSA VAT correctly as a baseline, as these are fundamental. (Covered in `saudi_compliance_considerations.yaml`)"

      - risk: "Increased Operational Overhead"
        description: >
          Managing billing and payments across two separate platforms (Paddle and Lago) plus the MCP
          orchestration layer can increase operational overhead for finance, support, and engineering teams
          compared to a single integrated platform like Stripe.
        mitigations:
          - "Automation: Automate routine tasks such as report generation, reconciliation, and monitoring as much as possible."
          - "Consolidated Dashboarding: Develop or utilize tools that can provide a unified view of key metrics from Paddle, Lago, and MCP."
          - "Clear Team Training: Ensure relevant teams are well-trained on their roles and responsibilities with respect to the new systems."
          - "Standardized Procedures: Develop clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for common tasks like refunds, disputes, manual subscription adjustments, etc."

      - risk: "Vendor Lock-in with Lago (Self-Hosted)"
        description: >
          While self-hosting Lago offers control, extensive customization around a self-hosted Lago
          instance could lead to a form of vendor lock-in, making future migrations to other billing
          systems potentially complex if Lago's development or community support wanes.
        mitigations:
          - "Adhere to Lago's Core Features: Prioritize using Lago's standard features and APIs as much as possible, minimizing highly custom modifications to Lago's core."
          - "Maintain Good Documentation: Document all interactions and configurations with Lago thoroughly."
          - "Data Export Strategy: Regularly ensure that data from Lago can be exported in a usable format, facilitating potential future migrations."
          - "Community Engagement: Actively participate in the Lago community to stay informed of its roadmap and contribute if possible."

      - risk: "User Dissatisfaction during Payment Method Re-capture"
        description: >
          Forcing users to re-enter their payment information (as detailed in `user_and_data_migration_impact.yaml` - Payment Methods Migration)
          can lead to user friction, dissatisfaction, and potentially churn if not handled smoothly.
        mitigations:
          - "Clear Communication: Proactively communicate the necessity of the change and the steps users need to take, emphasizing security and benefits."
          - "User-Friendly Re-capture Flow: Design a seamless and intuitive UI for payment method updates, leveraging Paddle.js for a smooth experience."
          - "Grace Period & Reminders: Offer a reasonable grace period for users to update their details and send multiple reminders before any service interruption."
          - "Support Availability: Ensure customer support is well-prepared to handle queries and issues related to payment method updates."

  data_migration_risks:
    title: "Data Migration Risks"
    items:
      - risk: "Data Loss or Corruption during Migration"
        description: >
          Migrating large volumes of customer, subscription, and historical payment data from Stripe
          to new systems (MCP database, Lago) carries the risk of data being lost, incorrectly mapped, or corrupted.
        mitigations:
          - "Comprehensive Data Mapping: Create a detailed mapping of all Stripe data fields to their new locations in MCP DB and Lago."
          - "Trial Migrations: Perform multiple trial migrations with subsets of data to test scripts and processes."
          - "Data Validation: Implement validation scripts to compare data between Stripe (source) and MCP/Lago (destination) post-migration to identify discrepancies."
          - "Backup Stripe Data: Before starting the migration, ensure a complete and verified backup of all Stripe data is taken and stored securely."
          - "Incremental Migration where Possible: For some data types, an incremental approach might reduce risk, though subscription data often requires a cutover."

      - risk: "Inaccuracies in Migrated Subscription Data"
        description: >
          Incorrectly migrating subscription details (e.g., renewal dates, plan types, quantities, trial end dates)
          to Lago can lead to immediate billing errors, affecting revenue and customer trust.
          (Reference: `user_and_data_migration_impact.yaml` - Subscription Data Migration)
        mitigations:
          - "Thorough Plan Mapping: Ensure Stripe plans are accurately mapped to corresponding Lago plans."
          - "Automated Migration Scripts: Use well-tested scripts for migrating subscription data, minimizing manual intervention."
          - "Pre-Migration Audit: Audit active Stripe subscriptions for any anomalies or non-standard configurations that might complicate migration."
          - "Post-Migration Verification: Select a statistically significant sample of migrated subscriptions in Lago and manually verify their details against the Stripe source."
          - "Dry Run Billing Cycle: If possible, conduct a simulated billing cycle in Lago with migrated data before going live to catch errors."

      - risk: "Handling of Payment History for Dispute Resolution"
        description: >
          If historical payment data from Stripe is not easily accessible or properly linked after migration,
          it could complicate handling disputes or chargebacks that arise for past transactions.
          (Reference: `user_and_data_migration_impact.yaml` - Payment History Migration)
        mitigations:
          - "Archive Stripe Data Securely: Ensure the exported Stripe payment history is stored in a way that is secure yet accessible for support teams."
          - "Link to Original Stripe IDs: When migrating customer or subscription data, maintain a reference to the original Stripe Customer ID and Subscription ID to easily look up historical transactions in the Stripe archive."
          - "Unified UI for Support: If feasible, provide support teams with a unified interface or clear procedures to access both new (Lago/Paddle) and historical (Stripe archive) payment information."

      - risk: "Extended Downtime or Service Disruption during Cutover"
        description: >
          The cutover process, especially for migrating active subscriptions and switching payment processing,
          could lead to extended downtime or periods where users cannot manage their subscriptions or make new purchases.
        mitigations:
          - "Detailed Cutover Plan: Develop a minute-by-minute cutover plan that includes all steps, responsible parties, and rollback procedures."
          - "Off-Peak Migration: Schedule the migration during a period of lowest user activity."
          - "Minimize Freeze Period: Design the process to minimize the "freeze" period where new signups or subscription changes are disabled."
          - "Clear User Communication: Inform users well in advance about any planned maintenance window."
          - "Rollback Strategy: Have a well-defined and tested rollback plan to revert to Stripe if critical issues arise during or immediately after migration."
